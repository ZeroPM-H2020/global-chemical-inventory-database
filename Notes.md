## Short and long term needs

1. More columns, tables will come in future.

- Need version control of the database

2. Enable key partners to update the database in an easy way.

- Update the original csvs.

3. Enable search, extract data in a flexible, user friendly way.

- Cross table search
- GraphQL API should serve the need.

4. Hosting.

- https://zenodo.org/ might be a good place to host static files, like csvs & dbs.
